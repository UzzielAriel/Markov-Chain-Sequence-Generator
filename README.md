# Markov Chain Sequence Generator

A Markov Chain Sequence Generator <br/>
Sequence generator that shows which states will be chosen in a given amount of steps for a given transition matrix. <br/>
This is found in `walk.py`

### Stationary probabilities of a Markov Chain

There are three methods used to calculate the stationary probabilities of a Markov Chain through simulation.

<ul>
	<li> Finding left eigen vectors (fastest)</li>
	<li> Matrix multiplication</li>
	<li> Iteration</li>
</ul>

You can find the theory behind Markov Chains on YouTube, they are very interesting and I recommend taking a look at it.
