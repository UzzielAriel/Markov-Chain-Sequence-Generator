# Markov-Chain-Sequence-Generator

A Markov Chain Sequence Generator

There are three methods used to calculate the stationary probabilities of a Markov Chain through simulation.

<ul>
	<li> Finding left eigen vectors (fastest) </li>
	<li> Matrix multiplication </li>
	<li> Iteration </li>
</ul>

There is also a sequence generator that shows which states will be chosen in a given amount of steps for a given transition matrix

You can find the theory behind Markov Chains on YouTube, they are very interesting and I recommend taking a look at it.
